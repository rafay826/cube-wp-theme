# cube-wp-theme
Animated Wordpress Theme with single-page cube rotation

1. Drop this folder in the themes directory of your WordPress
2. Activate theme
3. Entire page-transitions and CSS3 animation libraries are contained within their respective folders. The rotating-cube-transitions are customizable, but work as a single-page-application only. Redirecting to different sources or URL's won't trigger the animation.
